ðŸ”—game : [Rock Paper Scissors](https://digi-rock-paper-scissors.netlify.app/)

* This mini project is a simple, interactive Rock Paper Scissors game that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to allow users to play against the computer, with dynamic score tracking and a restart functionality.

* About This Project
    1. HTML Structure:
        * Created the basic structure using HTML5 to build the game interface.
        * Included external resources like images, fonts, and styles.
        * Defined interactive areas where users can select their choices (rock, paper, or scissors).
        * Incorporated elements for displaying the game score and computer's selection.

    2. CSS Styling:
        * Applied custom styles to the page using CSS variables for colors, fonts, and layout.
        * Designed responsive layout using media queries to ensure the game is playable on various devices.
        * Styled interactive elements (like buttons and images) with hover effects and transitions.
        * Used flexbox for organizing the elements in a neat and structured manner.

    3. JavaScript Functionality:
        * Implemented game logic to handle user input, computerâ€™s random selection, and determining the winner.
        * Utilized event listeners to detect userâ€™s choice and dynamically update the interface.
        * Created a scoring system to keep track of the score for both the user and the computer.
        * Handled game restart functionality to reset the game to its initial state.

    4. Game Logic:
        * Generated a random choice for the computer and compared it with the userâ€™s choice.
        * Determined the winner based on the standard rules of Rock Paper Scissors.
        * Displayed messages to indicate the result of each round (win, loss, or draw).

    5. Interactivity:
        * Added interactive elements like clickable images for choosing rock, paper, or scissors.
        * Provided a restart button to reset the game to its starting state.

* Skills Learned from this Project
    1. HTML5:
        * Learned how to structure a simple interactive webpage.
        * Gained knowledge of linking external resources like CSS and JavaScript files.
        * Used semantic HTML tags for better accessibility and structure.

    2. CSS:
        * Improved my skills in styling elements using CSS, especially using flexbox for layout.
        * Learned to create responsive designs with media queries to adjust layout and styling for different screen sizes.
        * Gained experience in customizing the appearance of interactive elements like buttons and images with hover effects.
        * Utilized CSS transitions for smooth visual feedback.

    3. JavaScript:
        * Learned how to write event-driven code using event listeners for interactive elements.
        * Gained an understanding of generating random numbers and using them to simulate the computerâ€™s choices.
        * Implemented logic to compare user and computer choices and determine a winner.
        * Worked with the DOM (Document Object Model) to update content dynamically based on user actions.

    4. Game Development Basics:
        * Understood the core principles of simple game development such as turn-based logic, win/loss conditions, and scoring.
        * Created a fun and interactive experience for the user through the Rock Paper Scissors game.

    5. Problem Solving:
        * Solved logical problems in determining the winner of the game by comparing choices.
        * Implemented a fair game system that randomly generates the computerâ€™s choice and ensures correct results.

    6. Project Organization:
        * Structured the project into multiple files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) for better maintainability and readability.
        * Learned how to work with multiple external files and link them together in a cohesive project.
